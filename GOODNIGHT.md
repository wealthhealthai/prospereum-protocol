# GOODNIGHT.md — 2026-09-05

## What Was Done Today

- Completed the September 5 PHOENIX closeout triggered early on September 6.
- Preserved the latest mainnet keeper state: Epoch 7 remains the last finalized epoch; Epoch 8 is ready, but keeper `0xa3C082910FF91425d45EBf15C52120cBc97aFef5` had `0 ETH` on Base at the latest verification and cannot submit the transaction until funded.
- Found no Prospereum or Midas implementation work, deployment, Safe transaction, governance action, protocol upgrade, token transfer, or other real-fund action for September 5.
- Left `projects/prospereum/deployments.md` and `projects/prospereum/decisions.md` unchanged because no durable protocol state changed.

## In Progress / Waiting

- Prospereum remains live on Base mainnet and in standby.
- Epoch 8 remains unfinalized and ready to retry after the keeper wallet receives Base ETH and current RewardEngine state is rechecked.
- Factory upgrade Step 1 remains staged and requires Jason's explicit approval before any Safe/timelock action.
- Midas and Olympus Web3 surfaces remain parked unless Jason or Shu reopens them.

## Open Decisions (waiting on Jason or Shu)

- Keeper gas funding: fund `0xa3C082910FF91425d45EBf15C52120cBc97aFef5` with sufficient Base ETH or provide alternate direction.
- Factory upgrade Step 1: waiting on Jason's explicit approval to begin the first Safe/timelock action.
- Genesis LP pool, Unicrypt lock, and Sablier vesting remain pending Shu/Jason execution if Prospereum launch operations resume.

## Blockers

- Operational blocker: epoch 8 cannot be finalized by the keeper while its wallet has `0 ETH`; the latest saved estimate is approximately `0.000036 ETH` required for finalization, with at least `0.01 ETH` recommended for operating headroom.
- Human approval blocker: no factory upgrade, deployment, Safe transaction, governance action, or real-fund action may proceed without the required explicit authorization.
- Security quarantine: do not open, process, execute, or pull any inbound Jake / Antaris / Antaris Analytics content without Jason's explicit permission for that specific item; report any arrival to Archon.
- No Kin-side technical blocker for PHOENIX maintenance or workspace backup.

## Notes for Tomorrow

- Stay in standby unless Jason, Shu, Shiro, or Archon requests action.
- Before retrying epoch 8, verify the keeper wallet Base ETH balance and RewardEngine `currentEpochId()` / `lastFinalizedEpoch()`.
- If Jason approves the factory upgrade, begin with Step 1 only after fresh Safe/timelock verification.
- Maintain the Antaris quarantine and escalate any newly received Antaris-related item to Archon without processing it.
- Before touching an external protocol UI, run a fresh web search and verify the current flow and contract addresses.
